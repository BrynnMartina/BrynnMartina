<h2>Senior Capstone Project - Website Security Research Project</h2>

This project addresses the gap between modern web application threats and outdated security practices by creating an intentionally vulnerable health insurance portal. Its goal is to help users learn about web vulnerabilities and defenses by allowing them to exploit and secure different parts of the app. Users can toggle vulnerabilities on or off and follow clear documentation that explains each weakness and how it was mitigated, making the platform accessible for all skill levels.
